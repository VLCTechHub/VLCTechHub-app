# VLCTechHub app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). Please refer to [its documentation](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli) for more info on the Expo CLI.

If you want to run the app direclty on your device, you can find a public link to the app on Expo: https://expo.io/@marcelkalveram/vlctechhub-app. 

On **Android**, you can just scan the QR code. For **iOS**, you'll have to wait until the app is in the app store as Expo isn't allowed to share apps publicly due to some Apple restrictions.

## Installing the app

You need the Expo CLI to run the app in the simulator or on a local device.

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Then install the app's dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Using the app

Run the following to open the Expo CLI that allows you to run the app on your device or in the simulator (among other things)

```
expo start
```
